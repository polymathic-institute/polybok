## Future Scenarios

With signals, drivers, consequences, and timelines mapped out, the next thing to do is to package these possible futures into scenarios or microfiction. *The goal of creating futures scenarios is to ultimately **provoke conversations** on a possible future.* Scenario allow exploration from various perspective, how are different groups affected and how would they react to these futures.

It may be useful to explore some of the excises in [Future Simulation](Literature%20Notes/Sustainability/Future%20Thinking/Future%20Simulation.md) before constructing scenarios.

World building is a technique that writers use to develop their story.

### Pick a horizon

The world should be set in a time horizon that is interesting to explore.

- Entrepreneurs looking to build an actual product or service may gravitate towards near term horizons.
- Sci-Fi writers may explore a much further horizon for world building.

### Pick a point-of-view (POV)

For beginners, it is recommended to pick yourself as your POV because you know yourself well and have the experiences to apply in world building.

Using a different perspective is possible with a lot of research, understanding the persona's pain points, values, etc.

Pick a location. Keep in mind that the further you move away from your own experiences, the more you'd need to research to understand the particular context and environment.

### World details

1. Pick a specific place; e.g., a street corner, the kitchen, at the airport waiting area.
2. Describe what the place look like; walls, ceiling, floors, etc.
3. Describe what objects are in this space; cars, cup, furniture, etc.
4. How do people/animals/bots interact with those objects?

Challenge all of your assumptions, then iterate again. Review the futures, horizons, and world context, and question the details from the previous iteration. 

> [!example]
Would there be streets at all in a world of flying cars?
If plants were intelligent, how would they move about?

Write a Microfiction - literally the shortest story you can imagine.

1. Set up the scene, based on the POV chosen.
2. Introduce a challenge, take inspiration from negative consequences.
3. Despite their best efforts, the character challenges grow into problems.
4. Faced with a crisis, the characters abandon old solutions to try something new.
5. The new approach makes a little progress.
6. The approach is refined, and the characters regained stability.
7. Conclude on the story, either triumphant or loss.

Magazines are a good medium for exploring alternative futures and storylines.
Now take the [Future Artifact](Literature%20Notes/Sustainability/Future%20Thinking/Future%20Artifact.md) that the characters used in their story, and create it today.
