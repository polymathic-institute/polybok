## Designing a Future Artifact

*Future artifacts are important in **provoking conversations** around a particular future, a well-designed future artifact captures the details and interactions of a possibly very different world.*

Create a features list, start by gathering all the information about this future world.

- Positive and negative aspect of the object.
- Horizon, which technologies would be needed to make the artifact.
- User profile, can be leveraged to design a particular user experience.
- Location, in which the object can relate to in terms of culture and materials.
- Journey, which describe the pain points and struggles that the characters experienced with the object.
- The place, space and interactions that the object has with its environment and user.

These details should have been established as part of [Future Simulation](Literature%20Notes/Sustainability/Future%20Thinking/Future%20Simulation.md) or [Future Scenario and World Building](Literature%20Notes/Sustainability/Future%20Thinking/Future%20Scenario%20and%20World%20Building.md).

### Assess technical feasibility

1. What and why (the purpose of the artifact).
2. Research.
3. Product, software and technical architecture, features, roadmap.
4. Vision: design tech, business

Give the artifact a name and a tagline to make it more real. i.e., It is something we are familiar with that does something with something else.

Build a mood board for the product. Gather a range of images that represent some aspect of the artifact, and then note down why and what each image brings (e.g., form, material, colour).

### Build a prototype

A prototype is an early model to prove a specific concept and to communicate the functionality of the artifact.

* *An **experiential prototype** is when a particular experience is recreated such that users can provide feedback on that experience.*
* *A **functional prototype** isÂ a sample or model of a product built to test a concept or process, this can include 3d renders or concept drawings.*

### Backcasting

Backcasting is a technique used to compliment trend analysis and probable futures. Note that this is rarely a linear process.

* ***Features-centric** backcasting is when the artifact is broken into functional components, and plot a timeline in which each feature would have been developed.*
* ***Purpose-driven** backcasting is when the purpose of the artifact is extracted, and that all iterations of this artifact over its timeline should resonate with that purpose.*

In the entrepreneurial world, an initial purpose-driven prototype is of called a Minimal Viable Product (MVP).
