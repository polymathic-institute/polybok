title: "Future Artifact"
---

Create a features list, start by gathering all the information about this future world.

- Positive and negative aspect of the object.
- Horizon, which technologies would be needed to make the artifact.
- User profile, can be leveraged to design a particular user experience.
- Location, in which the object can relate to in terms of culture and materials.
- Journey, which describe the pain points and struggles that the characters experienced with the object.
- The place, space and interactions that the object has with its environment and user.

1. What and why (the purpose of the artifact).
2. Research.
3. Product, software and technical architecture, features, roadmap.
4. Vision: design tech, business

Template:
It is something we are familiar with that does something with something else.

Give the artifact a name and a tagline to make it more real.

Build a mood board for the product. Gather a range of images that represent some aspect of the artifact, and then note down why and what each image brings (e.g., form, material, colour).

Build a prototype.
A prototype is an early model to prove a specific concept and to communicate the functionality of the artifact.

An experiential prototype is when a particular experience is recreated such that users can provide feedback on that experience.

A functional prototype isÂ a sample or model of a product built to test a concept or process, this can include 3d renders or concept drawings.

Backcasting

Backcasting is a technique used to compliment trend analysis and probable futures. Note that this is rarely a linear process.

Features-centric backcasting is when the artifact is broken into functional components, and plot a timeline in which each feature would have been developed.

Purpose-driven backcasting is when the purpose of the artifact is extracted, and that all iterations of this artifact over its timeline should resonate with that purpose.

In the entrepreneurial world, an initial purpose-driven prototype is of called a Minimal Viable Product (MVP).
