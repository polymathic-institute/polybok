title: "Future Simulation"

Think about what cannot be different in 10 or 20 years timeframe, it can be a cultural practice, a technological limitation, or a human behaviour. Feel free to list anything that you are nearly 100% certain, e.g., people would still measure their age in years and celebrate birthdays; on a clear weather day, the sky will be blue.

While working as a futurist, the most reliable way to get blindsided and shocked by change is to have something that you are 100% certain cannot change. Thus, it is important to unstick your mind by brainstorming things you currently believe cannot possibly change, and then brainstorm ways that they can.

> Statement: It takes one man and one woman to make one baby.
> Signals: Three-parent babies using genetic techniques to avoid genetic diseases; progress towards enabling genetic offspring for same-sex parents, and even purely artificial lab grown embryos with egg, sperm, nor womb involved.

The goal of this unstick excise is to develop psychological flexibility.

Predicting the Past

Think about a real choice that was made in the past, and imagine a different choice was made instead, and derive the different consequence that different choice might have made. E.g., if you had packed a bag and travelled somewhere this morning.

This exercise is useful for drawing the parallel that since the present could have been vastly different due to the past, so can the future be vastly different by actions taken in the present. On a side note, this technique is often used in treatment of depression to address the belief that nothing you do matters.
